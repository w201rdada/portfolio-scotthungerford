# Making Grocery Shopping Easy

## Beginning

The Making Grocery Shopping Easy application will assist users in finding the easiest and/or most affordable options to purchase groceries. 

## Middle

The user location data will first be manually input by the user. Based on the user’s location, the application will determine the grocery stores near the user (or around a user-inputted site). The nearby store data will utilize Google Maps to determine stores within a given radius. 

The user will then select items they would like to purchase, either through selecting a pre-determined recipe or by manual request.

There will be a database established that contains all grocery items, sizes, and availability. An algorithm will be developed to best determine the user requirements. The application will retrieve the item price data using three methods: 1) directly from cooperating stores; 2) published sale ads; and 3) multiple users input. 

The application will then ask how the user they would like to proceed with shopping and if they are willing to shop at multiple stores to save money on the grocery bill. This will be an iterative process to determine cost savings vs. effort. The application will then provide recommendations on which items should be purchased at each store.  

## End

The end product will be a list of grocery store locations for the user and ingredients to purchase at each store. Among the options are alternatives that will require more effort (visiting more stores or traveling longer distances) but will result in cost savings in the user’s purchases or vice versa (visiting less stores but more expensive items). Providing the user with a variety of selections allows the user the flexibility to make efficient decisions based on their needs.
