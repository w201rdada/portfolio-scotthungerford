The prediction model will utilize additional sensors and industry leading professional to improve prediction abilities. The sensors will gather the necessary information required for the models to provide a best estimate of where and when a natural disaster will occur. Abstract of my second cool idea The Making Grocery Shopping easy application will provide users with options to save money and/or time with their grocery shoppping. The application will provide recommendations where to shop, and if the user is willing to visit multiple stores, a path to the most cost savings.

["ARE-WE-Prepared.html", "1 How Prepared is your City for a Natural Disaster? 1.1 Natural Disasters 1.2 Criteria 1.3 Prediction Improvement 1.4 Response Improvement 1.5 Limitations and Measurements", " 1 How Prepared is your City for a Natural Disaster? 1.1 Natural Disasters As we have recently seen in the United States, natural disasters can cause loss of life and immense infrastructure damage. If a natural disaster were to happen in your city, how well prepared is the local government to mitigate for this? How long would it take to evacuate the danger zone? This study would evaluate how prepared a City and its citizens are for a natural disasters, and provide tools to utilities, first responders, and government agencies to improve reaction to natural disasters. 1.2 Criteria Natural disasters require both citizen and government cooperation to reduce loss of life and damage to infrastructure. Although natural disasters are notoriously difficult to predict, there may be methods that can assist with either prediction of natural disasters or increasing response time once a disaster has been correctly identified. These steps would have to be region specific, but this pilot study will focus on the City of Los Angeles. 1.3 Prediction Improvement Improving the ability to predict natural disasters is the first line of defense for a city’s preparation. The expansion of monitoring equipment will be the primary information source for this model. Monitoring equipment would include: 1) seismic monitoring equipment along fault lines; 2) wind and ocean monitoring for tsunami predictions; 3) temperature and humidity (lack of) gauges to predict forest fires; and 4) weather and surface water gauges to predict flash floods. Predictive analytics will utilize this data to develop models (lead by experts in climatology, geology, oceanography, hydrology, fire fighting, and engineering) to predict and track these disasters, and determine the areas that would be severely affected. The collected data would need to be implemented in an open source cloud to allow these specialized teams the ability to communicate and collaborate. These models would upload their predictions to a live geographical map that would utilize all the predictions and display which regions are impacted by certain natural disasters. This predictive model and map combination will allow cities to better prepare for natural disasters by knowing which disaster will occur and which region will be affected. Along with the predictions, population, utility (water and power) data will be implemented in the map to provide both first responders and agencies responsible for water and power appropriate data to enable them to minimize loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and number of citizens without access to clean water and electricity. 1.4 Response Improvement First responders will be able to access the generated live maps and determine which areas will demand their attention. The population data, populated through the U.S. Census Bureau, will provide a better understanding of the number of people affected as well as the number of elderly and children that may require special assistance. The general public’s live feed through social media and a direct information gathering platform will also be helpful in deciphering response requirements. The live feed could assist in deciphering which transit routes have been impacted and determine the optimal route for first responders. In terms of response time for potable water and power utilities, being notified of a natural disaster prior to its occurrence can be the difference between regions without access to clean water and power and those with access. This lead time will improve resource allocation and allow field crews use other methods to transmit water and power if they know the usual operational procedure will not suffice due to damaged infrastructure. An example of this would be to change the route of electricity flow if it is known power transmission towers in a particular region have an increased risk of being damaged. This minor modification of normal operations could produce positive results and avoid any service outages. 1.5 Limitations and Measurements There are many considerations that are required to determine a City’s natural disaster preparation. The items listed above only account for a small percentage of critical information. This study is intended to determine Cities’ preparation efforts as well as the general public’s ability to correctly react to a natural disaster. The limitation foreseen in this study is the natural disaster itself. We can not determine how severe the natural disasters can be, but preparation levels is a criteria that can be measured. The main challenge lies with the ability to manage these large data sets, process and decipher this data, and transmit this information to the masses when cellular, power, and internet may all be out of service.

Utilizing the user’s location, the application will determine the grocery stores near the user (or around a user inputted site) and the item availability at each store. The application will then provide recommendations on which items should be purchased at each store. The user will first select items they would like to purchase, either through a pre-determined recipe or manual request. 2.2 Middle There will be a database established that contains all grocery items, sizes, and availability. An algorithm will be developed to best determine the user requirements. The application will retrieve the item price data by one of the following three methods: 1) directly from cooperating stores; 2) published sale ads; and 3) multiple users input. The user location data will first be manually input by the user. The nearby store data will utilize Google Maps to determine stores within a given radius. The application will then determine how the user would like to proceed with shopping, and if they are willing to shop at multiple stores to save money on the grocery bill. This will be an iterative process to determine cost savings vs. effort. The algorithm will also determine 2.3 End The end product will be a list of grocery store locations for the user. Among the options are alternatives that will require more effort (visiting more stores or traveling longer distances) but will result in cost savings in the user’s purchases and vice versa (visiting less stores but more expensive items). Providing the user with a variety of selections allows the user the flexibility to make efficient decisions based on their needs. "]
