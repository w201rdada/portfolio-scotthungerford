## Natural Disasters

As we have recently seen in the United States, natural disasters can cause loss of life and immense infrastructure damage. If a natural disaster were to happen in your city, how well prepared is the local government to mitigate for this? How long would it take to evacuate the danger zone? This study would evaluate how prepared a City and its citizens are for a natural disasters, and what steps could be taken to increase preparation. 

## Criteria

Natural disasters require both citizen and government cooperation to reduce loss of life and damage to infrastructure. 
1.	Identification of danger zone for certain natural disasters (low elevation, near fault line, near landslides, near coastal region, etc.)
2.	Determine regional emergency responder requirement
3.	Local utility’s emergency preparation
4.	Identification of critical infrastructure and resiliency
5.	Time to evacuate impacted danger zones
6.	Location of stored food, water, and supplies

## Limitations and Measurements

There are many considerations that are required to determine a City’s natural disaster preparation. The items listed above only account for a small percentage or critical information. This study is intended to determine Cities’ preparation efforts as well as the general public. The limitation foreseen in this study is the natural disaster itself. We can not determine how severe the natural disasters can be, but preparation levels is a criteria that can be measured.
